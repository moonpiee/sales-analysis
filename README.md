# sales-analysis
This is my data analysis project for Product Sales done using SQL.
Data cleaning was cleaned while querying few fields. It is then queried to analyse the sales using MySQL for below tasks:
1. Across all their Product Line, which one is the best selling?
2. What was the best year for sales?
3. What was the best month for sales?
4. Which country sold the most product?
5. Who is the best customer?
6. Which customer to gain trust from yet?

Data is then visualised using charts in google sheets.
